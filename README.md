# umaimakhh-Palindrome-Dates-UKA
A palindrome date is a date that is the same when read forwards and backwards, e.g., ‘02/02/2020’. Write
a program that identifies and saves to a file all the palindrome dates in the 21st century using the
DD/MM/YYYY format. Do not use recursion. 

Do not use any built-in calendar-ish packages. To keep
things simple, treat leap years as regular years
